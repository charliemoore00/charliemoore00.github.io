Values close to 1 or -1 indicate more linear relationships. Given that there are three penguin species, the most helpful visual is one that shows three distinct clumps. This would then likely not be a linear correlation, and so values that are closer to zero may show clumped data. We can see some of the lowest correlations are Culmen Depth vs Culmen Length, Body Mass vs Culmen Depth, and Body Mass vs Culmen Length.\n\ncorr = X_train[[\"Culmen Length (mm)\", \"Culmen Depth (mm)\", \"Flipper Length (mm)\", \"Body Mass (g)\"]].corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following scatterplot shows the relationship between Culmen Depth (mm) on the X-axis and Body Mass (g) on the Y-axis. The scatterplot is colored by the sex of the penguin, with purple representing female and orange representing male. This scatterplot shows two distinct clusters of penguins, one in the upper left and the other bottom right. Since we have color-coded by gender, we can see that the clusters are not separated by gender! Perhaps the are separated by Species, in which case this relationship will be very important when creating a classification model. It’s likely that one of the penguin species is represented by the cluster in the upper left, and the other two are represented by the cluster in the bottom right. I make this assumption given that the lower right cluster is roughly twice the size of the other.\n\nsns.scatterplot(X_train, x=\"Culmen Depth (mm)\", y=\"Body Mass (g)\", hue=\"Sex_MALE\", palette=\"CMRmap\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDELETE LATER: The following plot proves the former hypothesis. We can efficiently separate Gentoo penguins from the other species using Body Mass (g) and Culmen Depth (mm). However, Chinstrap and Adelie penguins are not as easily separated.\n\nsns.scatterplot(train, x=\"Culmen Depth (mm)\", y=\"Body Mass (g)\", hue=\"Species\", palette=\"CMRmap\")"
