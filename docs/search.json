These also display inside the notebook, and get converted into your blog post:\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1001)\ny = np.sin(x)\nfig = plt.plot(x, y)\nxlab = plt.xlabel(\"x\")\nylab = plt.ylabel(\"y\")\ntitle = plt.gca().set(title = \"My Fancy Plot\")\nAnother thing we’ll often do is implement an algorithm in a source file (i.e. a .py file) and then use it in a notebook. To do this, just place the .py file in the same directory as the notebook. For example, the file source.py in the same directory contains a custom function (which prints a message). I can use like this:\nimport source \nsource.my_custom_function()\nsource.my_custom_function()\n\nI implemented this function in the file source.py\nI implemented this function in the file source.py"
